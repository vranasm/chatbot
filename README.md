Twitch Chatbot for streamers with only 1 monitor

Program is built in Java Swing. Main purpose is the ability to have overlay with transparency that shows Twitch chat while ingame on a single monitor

For OBS display the program generates chat.png image file which you can
connect into OBS as a image (check file updates on) - to get this
completely run you probably need to connect to chat and send couple
messages so the image file creates first.
the Chat overlay can be made transparent as you will see in the settings.
Don't forget "save settings" so it saves to disk the sizes, colors,
fonts etc.

The user colors are colors for usernames. You will have to test a bit
how you want to setup your font, colors scheme etc. 

Then there are some more features (icons, blocked patterns and some
stuff, just browse through a bit and try to guess the usage :-)).
